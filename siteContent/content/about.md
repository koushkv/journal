Hi there! I'm Koushik, a physics graduate student, Linux enthusiast and a coffee lover, and I spend most of my free time in music production and coding (and yes, I play PC games too). This is mostly a place for me to share things that I write. Feel free to explore and thanks for stopping by!

- :musical_keyboard: I do produce music, but mostly Indian Classical. You can find it in [Soundcloud](https://www.soundcloud.com/vkoushik) and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCDefv-sGUjZRtz56C-WISbQ)
- :book: Mostly sci-fi/fantasy. Here is my [goodreads profile](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37385970-koushik).
- :computer: I live by Spacemacs and org-mode and... VSCode

You can read about how I build and manage this site [here](https://vkoushik.netlify.app/howsite).
