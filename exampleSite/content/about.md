Hi there! I'm Koushik, a physics graduate student, Linux enthusiast and a coffee lover, and I spend most of my free time in music production and coding (and yes, I play PC games too). This blog is mainly to keep track of my work stuff and some other useful things that might be of help at a later point in time. Feel free to explore and thanks for stopping by!
