Hi there! I'm Koushik, a physics graduate student, Linux enthusiast and a coffee lover, and I spend most of my free time in music production and coding. This blog is to keep track of my work stuff (and other interesting things too) that can include things from writing in markdown to neural network architectures and a bit of audio engineering too.
